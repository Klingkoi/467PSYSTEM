Type A Project - Product System

Just the section purely of all my work so far (very work in progress)
I have seperate document named pdo-setup.php which contains a $username and $password to connect to the database we make
Much more stuff to do in this week:
 - make search bar
 - submit order button
 - delete from cart
 - calculate total cost and weight
 - integrate credit card system probably
